In this level you will be working with registers. You will be asked to modify
or read from registers.

We will now set some values in memory dynamically before each run. On each run
the values will change. This means you will need to do some type of formulaic
operation with registers. We will tell you which registers are set beforehand
and where you should put the result. In most cases, its rax.



Using your new knowledge, please compute the following:
  f(x) = mx + b, where:
    m = rdi
    x = rsi
    b = rdx

Place the result into rax.

Note: there is an important difference between mul (unsigned
multiply) and imul (signed multiply) in terms of which
registers are used. Look at the documentation on these
instructions to see the difference.

In this case, you will want to use imul.

We will now set the following in preparation for your code:
  rdi = 0x17a8
  rsi = 0x111b
  rdx = 0x1262

Please give me your assembly in bytes (up to 0x1000 bytes):
