Please perform the following:
  Place the value stored at 0x404000 into rax
  Increment the value stored at the address 0x404000 by 0x1337

Make sure the value in rax is the original value stored at 0x404000 and make sure
that [0x404000] now has the incremented value.

We will now set the following in preparation for your code:
  [0x404000] = 0x1e277b

Please give me your assembly in bytes (up to 0x1000 bytes):
