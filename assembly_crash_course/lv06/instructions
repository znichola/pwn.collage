Modulo in assembly is another interesting concept!

x86 allows you to get the remainder after a div operation.

For instance: 10 / 3 -> remainder = 1

The remainder is the same as modulo, which is also called the "mod" operator.

In most programming languages we refer to mod with the symbol '%'.

Please compute the following:
  rdi % rsi

Place the value in rax.

We will now set the following in preparation for your code:
  rdi = 0x1b0776e
  rsi = 0x3ff

Please give me your assembly in bytes (up to 0x1000 bytes):
