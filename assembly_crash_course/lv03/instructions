Many instructions exist in x86 that allow you to do all the normal
math operations on registers and memory.

For shorthand, when we say A += B, it really means A = A + B.

Here are some useful instructions:
  add reg1, reg2       <=>     reg1 += reg2
  sub reg1, reg2       <=>     reg1 -= reg2
  imul reg1, reg2      <=>     reg1 *= reg2

div is more complicated and we will discuss it later.
Note: all 'regX' can be replaced by a constant or memory location

Do the following:
  add 0x331337 to rdi

We will now set the following in preparation for your code:
  rdi = 0x773
